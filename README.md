# introduction

A project template that provides an opinionated starting point for a full stack application based on react and asp net core.

# use-cases / why

React and asp net core both are amazing technologies that focus and solve specific problems (building UIs and handling webrequests). By beeing clear about their intentions and not doing too much they can be great at solving their problems. However other problems that arise in your typical web or business-application are left out for the developer.

Often following problem-areas need to be tackled:

- Consistent set of ui controls
- Forms
- Client-side routing
- Consistent self-documented api
- CQRS

Fortunatly other developers already provide solutions to these problems. This project picks some of these and bundles them into a template.
